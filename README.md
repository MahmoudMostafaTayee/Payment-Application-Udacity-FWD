# ðŸ’³ Payment Application â€“ Udacity/FWD Embedded Systems Project

This project simulates a **card payment terminal** using **C programming**, developed as part of the *Embedded Systems Professional Nanodegree* scholarship provided by the **Egypt Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MCIT)** in collaboration with **Udacity** under the **FWD (Future Work is Digital)** initiative.

It mimics the core functionality of a real-world card swipe machine, processing transaction data, verifying card and terminal information, and handling basic payment authorization logic â€” all in pure C on a simulated embedded-like environment.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- ðŸ§¾ Card data collection (cardholder name, PAN, expiration date)
- ðŸ“† Terminal validation (expiry date check, transaction amount check, maximum limit)
- âœ… Transaction approval logic
- ðŸ§ª Modular functions to test and validate each component of the payment process
- ðŸ§¼ Clean separation between terminal, server, and card modules
